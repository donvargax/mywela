**MyWela** is a simple project-based time tracking software that is powered by Qt and PySide. This software is made for a purpose of learning Qt and PySide but it is used on my daily use as a freelance developer.

Thanks <a href="http://forum.ubuntu-nl.org/etalage/pyqt4-stopwatch-(met-geluid-via-sdl)/">StopWatch (PyQt4)</a> for code examples.

For PySide download and installation, please read [http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySideDownloads](http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySideDownloads)
