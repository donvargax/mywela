**MyWela** is a simple project-based time tracking software that is powered by Qt and PySide. Even though it is made for a purpose of learning Qt and PySide, it is used on my daily use as a freelance developer. It still missed some useful features such as a report.

Thanks <a href="http://forum.ubuntu-nl.org/etalage/pyqt4-stopwatch-(met-geluid-via-sdl)/">StopWatch (PyQt4)</a> for code examples.

Prerequisite softwares:
  * Qt4 (tested on v4.7.0)
  * PySide (tested on v1.0.6)
  * SQLite3 (tested on v3.7.2)

For PySide download and installation, please read [http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySideDownloads](http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySideDownloads)
